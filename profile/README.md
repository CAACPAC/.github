**Citizens Against AIPAC Corruption (CAAC)** is a national grassroots organization leveling the playing field against AIPAC's millions. We follow every dollar, expose every vote, and give you the tools to hold genocide enablers accountable.

Registered as a federal hybrid (Carey) PAC, CAAC combines investigative research, electoral organizing, and direct accountability campaigns to challenge AIPAC's outsized influence in American politics.

### What we do

- **Track** &mdash; Expose every member of Congress and federal candidate who accepts money from AIPAC and their allies, using FEC filings and OpenSecrets data.
- **Organize** &mdash; Endorse and back AIPAC-free champions, getting resources to principled candidates who refuse to be bought.
- **Disrupt** &mdash; Refuse to normalize genocide and apartheid. Every alert, briefing, and action keeps human rights at the forefront.
